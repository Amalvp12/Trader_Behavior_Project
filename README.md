Trader Behavior Insights Project

Objective:
Analyze the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed) and trader performance using historical trader data.

Datasets:

fear_greed_index.csv – Bitcoin market sentiment

historical_data.csv – Trader transaction data

Steps Taken:

Loaded and cleaned both datasets

Converted timestamps to readable dates

Merged datasets by date

Calculated daily trader performance

Visualized the relationship using boxplots and line charts

Insights:

Traders take more risks on “Greed” days, leading to higher profits or losses

Traders are more cautious on “Fear” days, leading to lower profits

Understanding market sentiment can help plan entry/exit points and manage risk
